Follow these instructions before starting the script !
Not everyone's computer has the same folder pathway so lets adjust the script's directory to this folder !

1. Open whirligiger.ahk in an editor of your choosing.
2. Look for the two lines of code marked by "; ########################## CHANGE FILE DIRECTORY".
3. Change the file directory to this folder's pathway along with the file names.
4. Once you're done. Save and you're ready to use Whirligiger !

Example:
